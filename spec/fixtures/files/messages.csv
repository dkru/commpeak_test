Rep. Lynwood McDermott,ryan.schmeler@doyle.name,Unweaving the Rainbow,Smart people underestimate the ordinarity of ordinary people.
Micki Fadel,jack@crooks.org,Recalled to Life,"I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it's not perfect for you. The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python."
Lanora Pacocha,frida.gibson@hettinger.org,Have His Carcase,"Sometimes people jot down pseudo-code on paper. If that pseudo-code runs directly on their computers, its best, isn't it? Ruby tries to be like that, like pseudo-code that runs. Python people say that too."
Nubia Johnston,danial@goyette.info,The Glory and the Dream,"Language designers want to design the perfect language. They want to be able to say, 'My language is perfect. It can do everything.' But it's just plain impossible to design a perfect language, because there are two ways to look at a language. One way is by looking at what can be done with that language. The other is by looking at how we feel using that language-how we feel while programming."
Mr. Zachery Denesik,lai@yost-johns.net,Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal,"Actually, I didn't make the claim that Ruby follows the principle of least surprise. Someone felt the design of Ruby follows that philosophy, so they started saying that. I didn't bring that up, actually."
David Walter,joey.nader@willms.co,O Pioneers!,"Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines."
Vicki West,harley_bode@pagac.info,The Golden Bowl,"Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, 'I was surprised by this feature of the language, so therefore Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.' Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only."
Brandi Ziemann,carson_russel@mosciski.io,Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,"Most programs are not write-once. They are reworked and rewritten again and again in their lived. Bugs must be debugged. Changing requirements and the need for increased functionality mean the program itself may be modified on an ongoing basis. During this process, human beings must be able to read and understand the original code. It is therefore more important by far for humans to be able to understand the program than it is for the computer."
Silvana Metz,kayce.howe@langosh.com,Things Fall Apart,"I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it's not perfect for you. The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python."
Sen. Erwin Quitzon,keesha.koelpin@price.biz,The Stars' Tennis Balls,"The orthogonal features, when combined, can explode into complexity."
